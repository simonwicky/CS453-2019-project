# CS-453 - Course project

Your goal is to implement a Software Transactional Memory (STM).

The *real* goal is of course to get you a hands-on experience with actual concurrent programming.


## Layout of this repository

* `grading/` Directory containing the evaluation binary, to test your solution on your own machine.

   The evaluation machine (see below sections **Evaluation machine** and **Sending your code for measurement**) runs the exact same binary (possibly with a different _seed_ though).

   Section **How to write my own STM?** further details testing (and later submitting your code).

* `include/` C and C++ headers files that define the public interface of your STM.

* `template/` Template (in C) of _your_ implementation, but you're free to replace everything and write C++.

* `reference/` Reference, single lock-based implementation.

   Note that you are not allowed to write an implementation that is _equivalent_ to this reference implementation, i.e., that uses a single, global lock to serialize transactions.
   When in doubt, ask the TA right away for clarifications.

* `playground/` As its name suggests, _playground_ is to play with the C(++)11 atomics. We'll be using it on the second week only, when we will be implementing a simple mutex.


## What prior knowledge do I need?

Only basic C or C++ knowledge.

How to use the atomic libraries and the memory models of C11 and C++11 will be taught in the weekly project sessions.

### Useful resources

## What is a STM?

* [This course](http://lpd.epfl.ch/site/education/ca_2019).

* The Art of Multiprocessor Programming - Chapter 18.

### Some implementations out there

* [TinySTM](https://github.com/patrickmarlier/tinystm) 

* [LibLTX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libltx)

* [stmmap](https://github.com/skaphan/stmmap)

You may read and inspire from existing STM libraries, but it must be **your own code** that carries out transactions.


## Grading

* *Correctness* is a must.

   The executed transactions must satisfy three properties (see below). No correctness = no passing grade for the project.

* *Throughput* is to go from a passing grade to the maximum grade.

   Comparison of your implementation to the reference one. Metric: #transaction *commits* per second.

### Evaluation machine

* 2 (dual-socket) Intel(R) Xeon(R) 10-core CPU E5-2680 v2 at 2.80GHz (Ã—2 hyperthreading => 40 virtual cores)

* 256 GB of RAM, so you can consider RAM "unlimited" in your implementation

* Operating system: GNU/Linux (distribution: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)


## How to write my own STM?

1. Clone/download this repository.

2. Make a local copy of/rename the `template` directory with your SCIPER number (e.g. `$ cp -r template 123456`). Be aware `make` is sensitive to spaces in the path/names.

3. Complete or completely rewrite (your copy of) the template with **your own code**.

   1. Complete/rewrite your code; only the interface should be kept identical.

   2. Compile and test locally with: `path/to/directory/grading$ make build-libs run`.

   3. Send your code to the *measurement server* for testing on the *evaluation machine*.

   4. Repeat any of the previous steps until you are satisfied with correctness and performance.

### Sending your code for measurement

1. Zip your modified (copy of the) `template` directory.

2. Send your code for evaluation with the `submit.py` script.
```
usage: submit.py [-h] --uuid UUID [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--force-update] [--download] zippath

positional arguments:
  zippath         Path to a zip file containing your library code,
                                  or that will be overwritten with '--download'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --uuid UUID     Secret user unique identifier
  --host HOST     Server hostname
  --port PORT     Server TCP port
  --force-update  Update your submission to the server; no validation of the correctness of your submission will be performed
  --download      Download your submission currently kept for grading under 'zippath' (instead of submitting a new one);
                  if '--force-update' is used, a "swap" is performed
```

You can submit code as often as you want until the deadline.

Only the (correct) submission with the highest speedup will be stored persistently and considered for grading, so no need to resubmit your best implementation just before the deadline.
The TAs may still ask you to provide a copy of your best implementation though (possibly after the deadline), so do not delete anything before the end of the semester.

As an option from the `submit.py` script, you can force-replace your submission with another one.
Note that no compilation nor performance check is performed.
The submission script also allows you to download the submission considered for your grade, so you can make sure the system has the version you want it to keep.

### List of structures and functions to implement

The student may write her/his library either in C11 (and above) or C++11 (and above).

## Interface specification

### Overview and properties

To use this *Software Transactional Memory* (STM) library, the *user* (e.g. the `grading` tool) first creates a new shared memory region.
A **shared memory region** is a non-empty set of shared memory segments.
Shared memory region creation and destruction are respectively managed by `tm_create` and `tm_destroy`.
The content of the shared memory region is *only* accessed from inside a transaction, and *solely* by the use of the functions mentioned below.

A **transaction** consists of a sequence of `tm_read`, `tm_write`, `tm_alloc`, `tm_free` operations in a shared memory region, enclosed between a call to `tm_begin` and a call to `tm_end` (as well as any number of non-transactional operations in private memory).
A transaction is executed on one and only one shared memory region.
A transaction either *commits* its speculative updates to the shared memory region when `tm_end` is reached, or *aborts* its execution (discarding its speculative updates) at any time (see the reference).
When a transaction is aborted, the *user* (i.e. the `grading` tool for this project) is responsible for retrying the *same* transaction (i.e. *going back* to the same `tm_begin` call site).

Transactions executed on the same shared region must satisfy three properties:

* **Atomicity**

   All speculative memory updates of a transaction are either committed or discarded as a unit.

* **Consistency**

   A (pending) transaction observes its own modifications, e.g. a read following one or more writes observes the last value written in program order.
   Transactions appear to have been committed one at a time.

* **Isolation**

   No speculative memory update is visible outside of their transaction, until their transaction commits.

### Reference

Create (i.e. allocate + init) a new shared memory region, with one first, non-free-able allocated segment of the requested size and alignment.

* `shared_t tm_create(size_t size, size_t align);`

| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `size` | Size of the first shared segment of memory to allocate (in bytes), must be a positive multiple of the alignment |
| `align` | Alignment (in bytes, must be a power of 2) that the shared memory region must support |

> **NB:** no concurrent call for the same shared memory region.

> **NB:** it is guaranteed that when this function is called the associated shared memory region has not been destroyed yet.

> **NB:** it is guaranteed that no transaction is running on the shared memory region when this function is called.
